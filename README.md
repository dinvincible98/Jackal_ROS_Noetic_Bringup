## Introduction
This README contains instructions of bringing up Clearpath Jackal on ROS noetic which is newest verison of ROS. Since many packages used for Jackal are not officially released for ROS noetic, this instruction will guide you how to build and set up jackal from scratch. Thanks for Jordan Haskel, our previous MSR student who wrote the [ROS Melodic(previous verison) bringup](https://github.com/robo-jordo/jackal_melodic_bringup) for Jackal and it helps me a lot in the buidling process.
